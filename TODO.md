2.  Hide / show control points

#### Add back easing

(See https://gre.github.io/bezier-easing-editor/example/), basically pass each ratio to an easing function before using it.

```
// const easeX = BezierEasing(0, 0, 1, 1)
// const easeY = BezierEasing(0, 0, 1, 1)
const easedRatioX = easeX(ratioX)
```
